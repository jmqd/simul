* DONE Poisson creation helper functions for Agents
* DONE Add Default implementation for SimulationParameters
* DONE Add Default implementation for Agent?
* DONE create typedef for u64 for discrete time
** DONE Fix Agent Debug derive for stable rust (nightly only, apparently)
This wasn't a nightly issue, this was a rust version issue.

This reproduced the issue:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo +1.69.0 build
#+END_SRC

But 1.70.0 is fine.

Fixed by adding rust-version to cargo.toml.
